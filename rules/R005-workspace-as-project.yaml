  ## Rule Statement
  
  The workspace root MUST follow the exact same structure as any other project. There MUST be no special folders or exceptions. The workspace's system files (templates, rules, scripts) live directly at the root alongside other project files.
  
  ## Rationale
  
  This principle:
  - Eliminates special cases and exceptions
  - Makes the system self-demonstrating
  - Simplifies learning and maintenance
  - Proves the system works at any scale
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Workspace structure:
     ```
     deepworkspace/
     ├── README.md      # Workspace documentation  
     ├── docs/          # Documentation including PSD.md
     ├── templates/     # System templates
     ├── rules/         # Workspace rules
     ├── scripts/       # System scripts
     └── .untracked/    # Local workspace
         └── repos/     # Child projects
     ```
  
  2. Key insight:
     - No ".deepworkspace" or special system folder
     - System files live at root level like any project
     - The workspace IS a project, no exceptions
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Correct
  ```
  deepworkspace/
  ├── README.md          # Standard project file
  ├── docs/              # Standard documentation folder
  ├── templates/         # Project files (happen to be templates)
  ├── rules/             # Project files (happen to be rules)
  ├── scripts/           # Project files (happen to be scripts)
  └── .untracked/        # Standard untracked folder
  ```
  
  ### Incorrect
  ```
  deepworkspace/
  ├── README.md
  ├── .deepworkspace/    # Wrong: special folder
  ├── system/            # Wrong: special folder
  ├── content/           # Wrong: we don't use content folders
  └── projects/          # Wrong: causes git nesting
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify this rule is being followed:
  - [ ] Workspace has README.md, docs/PSD.md
  - [ ] System files are at root level
  - [ ] No special folders at root
  - [ ] Structure identical to any project
