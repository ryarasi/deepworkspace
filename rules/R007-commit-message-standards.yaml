  ## Rule Statement
  
  All git commits MUST follow template T005, including context, changes, testing, and references sections. Commits MUST preserve the full context of why changes were made, not just what changed.
  
  ## Rationale
  
  Detailed commit messages:
  - Preserve decision context for future AI agents
  - Enable understanding without external references
  - Create self-documenting history
  - Facilitate debugging and rollbacks
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Commit message structure:
     ```
     [type]: [Brief description - 50 chars max]
     
     ## Context
     - Task ID: [Reference]
     - Feature Branch: [Branch name]
     - Purpose: [Why needed]
     
     ## Changes
     - [Specific changes listed]
     
     ## Testing
     - [How verified]
     
     ## References
     - [Related items]
     ```
  
  2. Commit types:
     - `feat`: New feature
     - `fix`: Bug fix
     - `docs`: Documentation only
     - `style`: Formatting, no code change
     - `refactor`: Code restructuring
     - `test`: Test additions/changes
     - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
  
  3. Key requirements:
     - First line under 50 characters
     - Include task/issue reference
     - List specific changes
     - Document verification steps
     - Reference rules/templates used
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Correct
  ```
  feat: Add workspace initialization script
  
  ## Context
  - Task ID: #005
  - Feature Branch: feature/v3-implementation
  - Purpose: Provide easy setup for new users
  
  ## Changes

  - Included placeholder for future features
  
  ## Testing
  - Verified script executes properly

  ## References

  - Related to: Workspace v3.0.0 setup
  ```
  
  ### Incorrect
  ```
  Updated files
  
  [No context, no details, no references]
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify this rule is being followed:
  - [ ] Commit follows T005 template structure
  - [ ] All sections are filled out
  - [ ] First line is descriptive and concise
  - [ ] Context explains why, not just what
