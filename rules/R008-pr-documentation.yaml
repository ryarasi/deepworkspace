  ## Rule Statement
  
  All pull requests MUST follow template T006, including the complete original user request, implementation decisions, and comprehensive change summary. PRs MUST serve as permanent context records for AI agents.
  
  ## Rationale
  
  Complete PR documentation:
  - Preserves original intent and context
  - Documents AI decision-making process
  - Creates traceable history
  - Enables future agents to understand past changes
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Required PR sections:
     - Summary of changes
     - Full context (who, what, when, why)
     - Complete user request (verbatim)
     - AI implementation notes
     - Verification checklist
     - File changes summary
  
  2. Critical elements:
     - ALWAYS include original user request
     - Document any interpretations made
     - Explain implementation choices
     - Note deviations from request
     - List all affected files
  
  3. PR creation process:
     ```bash
     gh pr create \
       --title "feat: Description" \
       --body "$(cat pr-body.md)" \
       --base main \
       --head feature/branch
     ```

  ```
  
  ### Incorrect

  ```
