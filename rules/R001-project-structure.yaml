  ## Rule Statement
  
  Every project (including the workspace root) MUST have:
  - README.md - Universal documentation for humans and AI with metadata
  - docs/ - Project documentation (always includes PSD.md)
  - .untracked/ - Local workspace including cloned child projects in repos/
  
  Project files live directly at the root level alongside these required items.
  
  ## Rationale
  
  - **Minimal**: Can't remove anything without losing functionality
  - **Fractal**: Same pattern works for any size or complexity
  - **No redundancy**: Each piece of information lives in exactly one place
  - **Clean git**: Child projects are independent repos in .untracked/repos/
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. When creating a new project:
     - Create the project directory
     - Add README.md with metadata, purpose, and child projects list
     - Create .untracked/ for local workspace
     - Create docs/ with PSD.md for project specifications
     - Create .gitignore to exclude .untracked/ and .claude/
  
  2. README.md includes:
     - Metadata section (name, type, purpose, etc.)
     - Overview for both humans and AI
     - Projects section listing immediate children only
     - Reference to docs/PSD.md for detailed specifications
     - Setup instructions
  
  3. Child projects:
     - Listed in parent's README.md Projects section
     - Cloned into parent's .untracked/repos/
     - Each maintains its own independent git repository
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Minimal (no content yet)
  ```
  my-project/
  ├── README.md
  └── .untracked/
      └── repos/
  ```
  
  ### With project files
  ```
  my-project/
  ├── README.md
  ├── docs/
  │   └── PSD.md
  ├── [project files at root]
  ├── src/           # Example project directory
  ├── tests/         # Example project directory
  └── .untracked/
      ├── repos/
      │   └── [cloned child projects]
      └── local/
          └── [workspace files]
  ```
  
  ### Incorrect
  ```
  my-project/
  ├── README.md
  ├── CLAUDE.md      # Wrong: redundant with README
  ├── content/       # Wrong: we don't use content folders
  ├── CONTRIBUTING.md # Wrong: should be in docs/
  └── projects/      # Wrong: causes git nesting issues
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify this rule is being followed:
  - [ ] Project has README.md with metadata, overview, projects list
  - [ ] Project has .untracked/ directory (gitignored)
  - [ ] Project has docs/ directory with PSD.md
  - [ ] No other files/folders at project root (except .git, .gitignore)
  - [ ] Child projects are in .untracked/repos/, not tracked
  
references:
  - "T002"  # README template with metadata
  - "T010"  # PSD template
  - "R005"  # Workspace as project
  
exceptions:
  - ".git/" directory for version control
  - ".gitignore" file at any level
