# ML Internship Assignment

<!-- This file follows template @content/templates/T002 -->

## Metadata
- **Type**: code
- **Created**: 2025-07-03
- **Status**: active
- **Parent**: root

## Purpose

This project contains machine learning internship assignments and exercises designed to demonstrate proficiency in ML concepts, implementation skills, and problem-solving abilities. It serves as a portfolio of work for internship applications and technical assessments.

## Structure

This project follows the standard DeepWorkspace structure:
- `README.md` - This file
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI context and instructions
- `content/` - ML assignments, notebooks, datasets, and code implementations
- `projects/` - No sub-projects

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the `content/` directory to find assignment implementations
2. Each assignment is organized in its own subdirectory with notebooks and supporting code
3. Run `jupyter notebook` in the content directory to explore the assignments

## Key Information

- **Focus Areas**: Machine learning algorithms, deep learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation
- **Technologies**: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Assignment Types**: Coding challenges, research implementations, data analysis tasks

## Sub-Projects

No sub-projects - all assignments are organized within the content/ directory.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab
- Machine learning libraries (requirements.txt in content/)
- Access to common ML datasets

## Status & Roadmap

Current focus: Setting up project structure and organizing assignments

Next steps:
- [ ] Create requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- [ ] Implement first assignment/challenge
- [ ] Add documentation for each completed assignment
- [ ] Create portfolio summary of completed work
