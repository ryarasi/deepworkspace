  ## Rule Statement
  
  This Project MUST organize governance with proper hierarchy:
  - All rules, templates, and scripts within docs/rules/
  - Templates nested in docs/rules/templates/
  - Scripts nested in docs/rules/scripts/
  - Dependencies contained within what depends on them
  
  ## Rationale
  
  This hierarchical structure:
  - Reflects true dependencies (scripts/templates serve rules)
  - Creates a self-contained governance system
  - Makes the entire rule system portable
  - Clarifies that governance is documentation
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Governance structure:
     ```
     docs/
     ├── RULES.md           # Entry point
     └── rules/             # Complete governance
         ├── R001-R006...   # Core rules
         ├── templates/     # Templates serve rules
         └── scripts/       # Scripts enforce rules
     ```
  
  2. Key insights:
     - Scripts and templates are dependencies of rules
     - Everything needed for governance in one place
     - Copy docs/rules/ to any project for complete system
     - No scattered system files
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Correct Hierarchy
  ```
  this-project/
  └── docs/
      ├── RULES.md
      └── rules/
          ├── R001-project-structure.yaml
          ├── R002-template-integrity.yaml
          ├── templates/       # Nested under rules
          │   ├── T001...
          │   └── T002...
          └── scripts/         # Nested under rules
              └── validate
  ```
  
  ### Incorrect (Flat Structure)
  ```
  this-project/
  ├── rules/         # Wrong: not hierarchical
  ├── templates/     # Wrong: not under rules
  └── scripts/       # Wrong: not under rules
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify governance hierarchy:
  - [ ] docs/rules/ contains all governance
  - [ ] docs/rules/templates/ contains templates
  - [ ] docs/rules/scripts/ contains scripts
  - [ ] No governance files outside docs/rules/
  - [ ] Can copy docs/rules/ for complete system

  - "R001"  # Defines docs/rules/ structure
  - "R006"  # Scripts within governance

exceptions:
  - "None - hierarchy is essential"
