  # Rule Manifest
  
  <!-- This file follows template @templates/T011 -->
  
  ## Core Rules (Immutable)
  
  These rules are copied from the parent project and must not be modified:
  
  - **R001**: Project Structure - Defines required directories and files
  - **R002**: Template System Integrity - Ensures templates are valid and consistent
  - **R003**: Self-Demonstration Principle - Project uses its own patterns
  - **R004**: Reference Integrity - All references must resolve
  - **R005**: Project Files at Root - System files at root level
  - **R006**: Script Validation Requirements - Scripts must validate rules
  
  ## Extension Rules (Project-Specific)
  
  This project has added the following custom rules:
  
  <!-- List R007+ rules here as they are added -->
  <!-- Example:
  - **R007**: Code Style Guidelines - Project-specific coding standards
  - **R008**: Testing Requirements - Minimum test coverage rules
  -->
  
  ## Rule Precedence
  
  1. Core rules (R001-R006) take precedence and cannot be overridden
  2. Extension rules (R007+) add additional requirements
  3. Extension rules must not conflict with core rules
  4. If conflict detected, core rule wins
  
  ## Validation
  
  Run `scripts/validate` to check compliance with all rules.

  Documents which rules apply to this project. Core rules are immutable and copied from parent. Extension rules are project-specific additions.
