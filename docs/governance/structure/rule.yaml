  ## Rule Statement
  
  This Project MUST maintain the following structure:
  - README.md - References docs/RULES.md for governance
  - docs/ - Project documentation
  - docs/RULES.md - Entry point to the rule system
  - docs/rules/ - Complete governance system
  - docs/PSD.md - Project Specification Document
  - .untracked/ - Local directory for temporary files
  
  ## Rationale
  
  This structure:
  - Creates a clear hierarchy with dependencies nested appropriately
  - Makes projects self-sufficient with embedded governance
  - Keeps all rules, templates, and scripts together
  - Provides a single entry point for understanding governance
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Required files and directories:
     - README.md - Simple reference to docs/RULES.md
     - docs/RULES.md - Explains the rule system and links to R001
     - docs/PSD.md - Project Specification Document following T010
     - docs/rules/ - Contains the complete governance system:
       - R001-R006 core rules (this file and others)
       - templates/ - All project templates
       - scripts/ - Validation and enforcement scripts
     - .untracked/ - Local untracked directory (gitignored)
  
  2. Governance hierarchy:
     - README.md → docs/RULES.md → R001 → R002 → ... → R006
     - Each rule references the next, creating a chain
     - Scripts and templates support rule enforcement
  
  3. Self-containment:
     - Copy docs/rules/ to any project for complete governance
     - All dependencies included within rules directory
     - No external references needed
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Compliant Structure
  ```
  this-project/
  ├── README.md        # "This project follows docs/RULES.md"
  ├── docs/
  │   ├── RULES.md     # Entry point to rules
  │   ├── PSD.md       # Project specification
  │   └── rules/       # Complete governance
  │       ├── R001-project-structure.yaml
  │       ├── R002-template-integrity.yaml
  │       ├── ...
  │       ├── templates/
  │       └── scripts/
  └── .untracked/      # Local directory
  ```
