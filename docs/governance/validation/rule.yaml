  ## Rule Statement
  
  This Project's validation scripts MUST:
  - Work correctly on this project itself
  - Validate all rules in docs/rules/ directory
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages
  - Support both validation and auto-fix modes
  
  ## Rationale
  
  Scripts are executable documentation that:
  - Prove rules are enforceable
  - Demonstrate patterns are practical
  - Provide automated quality assurance
  - Enable self-validation of the system
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Core scripts:
     - `docs/rules/scripts/validate` - Check rule compliance
     - `docs/rules/scripts/fix` - Auto-fix common issues
     - `docs/rules/scripts/create` - Create new sub-projects
     - `docs/rules/scripts/help` - Show available commands
  
  2. Validation coverage:
     - R001: Project structure
     - R002: Template integrity
     - R003: Self-demonstration
     - R004: Reference integrity
     - R005: Governance hierarchy
     - R006: Script validation (meta!)
  
  3. Local rule discovery:
     - Scripts look for rules in docs/rules/ directory
     - No hardcoded rule assumptions
     - Support for project extensions (R007+)
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Validation Success
  ```bash
  $ cd this-project
  $ docs/rules/scripts/validate
  ✓ Project structure correct (R001)
  ✓ Template integrity maintained (R002)
  ✓ Self-demonstration active (R003)
  ✓ All references valid (R004)
  ✓ Governance hierarchy correct (R005)
  ```
  
  ### Validation Failure
  ```bash
  $ docs/rules/scripts/validate
  ✗ Template integrity violation (R002)
    Template T999 referenced but not found
    Fix: Remove reference or create template
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify script validation:
  - [ ] docs/rules/scripts/validate works on this project
  - [ ] All rules have validation logic
  - [ ] Error messages are helpful
  - [ ] Fix suggestions are accurate
  - [ ] Scripts handle edge cases
  - [ ] Scripts discover rules locally

exceptions:
  - None. Scripts must work.
