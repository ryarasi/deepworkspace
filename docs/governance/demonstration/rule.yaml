  ## Rule Statement
  
  This Project MUST demonstrate its own patterns work by:
  - Using its own templates for all applicable files
  - Following its own rules without exception
  - Passing its own validation scripts
  - Serving as a reference implementation
  
  ## Rationale
  
  This project's credibility depends on proving its patterns work at scale. By using its own system, this project:
  - Validates that templates are practical
  - Shows rules are achievable
  - Provides real examples of every pattern
  - Maintains system integrity through self-application
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Template usage:
     - README.md MUST follow template T002
     - docs/PSD.md MUST follow template T010
     - All rules MUST follow rule structure
     - All templates MUST follow template structure
  
  2. Rule compliance:
     - Project structure follows R001
     - Templates maintain integrity per R002
     - Scripts validate these requirements
  
  3. Validation:
     - `docs/rules/scripts/validate` must pass on this project
     - Scripts must work on this project itself
     - Changes must maintain compliance
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Self-Application
  ```
  this-project/
  ├── README.md      # References docs/RULES.md
  └── docs/
      ├── RULES.md   # Entry point
      └── rules/
          ├── R001...    # All follow rule structure
          ├── R003...    # This very rule
          └── templates/
              ├── T001...    # All follow template structure
              └── T002...    # Used by README.md
  ```
  
  ### Validation Success
  ```bash
  $ cd /path/to/this-project
  $ docs/rules/scripts/validate
  ✓ Structure follows R001
  ✓ Templates have integrity (R002)
  ✓ Self-demonstration active (R003)
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify self-demonstration:
  - [ ] README.md follows T002
  - [ ] docs/PSD.md follows T010
  - [ ] All templates have valid structure
  - [ ] All rules have valid structure
  - [ ] Validation passes on this project
  - [ ] Scripts work on this project itself

exceptions:
  - None. Self-demonstration is absolute.
