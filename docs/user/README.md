# User Documentation

This directory is for unstructured user files and documentation that doesn't follow the governance templates.

## Purpose
- User-created documentation
- Project-specific notes
- Custom guides
- Meeting notes
- Design documents
- Any content that doesn't fit the structured format

## Guidelines
- No structure is enforced here
- Organize as you see fit
- Can contain any file types
- Subdirectories are allowed

## Note
This is intentionally unstructured to give users freedom to organize their content as needed, while keeping the governance system separate and clean.
