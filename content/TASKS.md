# DeepWorkspace Implementation Tasks

## v3.0.0 Implementation Status

### Core Implementation ✓
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create .gitignore with proper content tracking
- [x] Create pre-commit hooks for branch protection
- [x] Implement feature branch workflow
- [x] Create complete directory structure
- [x] Create helper scripts (dws commands)
- [x] Update README.md to v3.0.0
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md with fractal context
- [x] Create templates (T001-T007)
- [x] Create rules (R001-R009)

### DWS CLI Tool ✓
- [x] Create dws main dispatcher
- [x] Implement dws create command (with git init)
- [x] Implement dws start command (with Claude integration)
- [x] Add shell function setup to README
- [x] Support .claude directory in project structure
- [x] Add TASKS.md to project templates

### Enhanced Project Structure ✓
- [x] Update templates to include .claude directory
- [x] Add TASKS.md to gitignore patterns
- [x] Implement git initialization in project creation
- [x] Create R009 rule for remote push requirement
- [x] Add GitHub push as priority task in new projects

### Configurable Content Tracking ✓
- [x] Update R002 to allow project-level content tracking choice
- [x] Add "Track Content" metadata to README template
- [x] Update R001 to require tracking preference declaration
- [x] Modify dws create to respect tracking preference
- [x] Fix broken pre-commit hook (removed dependency on .pre-commit-config.yaml)
- [x] Update all datetime formats to ISO 8601 with timezone

### Validation & Enforcement ✓
- [x] Create dws validate command with structural checks
- [x] Create dws fix command for auto-fixable issues
- [x] Add clear limitations about semantic validation
- [x] Update dws help with new commands

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Test dws validate and fix commands
- [ ] Create PR for configurable content tracking
- [ ] Merge to main and cleanup feature branch

### Near Term
- [x] Create dws validate command - DONE
- [x] Create dws fix command - DONE
- [ ] Create dws archive command  
- [ ] Create dws protect command
- [ ] Implement automated template validation
- [ ] Add project dependency tracking

### Future Roadmap
- [ ] GitHub issue-based change tracking
- [ ] Automated PR workflow for content changes
- [ ] Cross-project dependency management
- [ ] Enhanced archival system with compression
- [ ] Project health dashboard
- [ ] Template inheritance system
- [ ] Rule enforcement automation
- [ ] **NLP Integration for Semantic Rule Validation**:
  - Explore local LLM integration (ollama, llama.cpp)
  - Consider API-based validation (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Design plugin architecture for advanced validation
  - Enable detection of semantic rule contradictions

## Architecture Notes

### Completed Design Decisions
- Fractal architecture: Projects within projects
- Template-driven consistency (T-series)
- Rule-based governance (R-series)
- Git-first workflow with PR requirements
- Content folder isolation from metadata
- DWS CLI for project operations

### Open Questions
- Should archived projects maintain git history?
- How to handle cross-project dependencies?
- Should templates support inheritance?
- How to automate rule validation?

## Version History
- v1.0.0: Original deepwork concept
- v2.0.0: v0.deepworkspace implementation
- v3.0.0: Current implementation with DWS CLI and enhanced structure
