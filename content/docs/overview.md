## What is DeepWorkspace?

DeepWorkspace is a minimalist, template-driven workspace management system that brings order to chaos through fractal architecture, where every project follows the same self-similar pattern, enabling infinite nesting while maintaining simplicity at its core.

## Core Features

DeepWorkspace brings order to chaos through:

- **Fractal Architecture**: Every project follows the same pattern, projects can contain projects
- **Template-Driven**: Consistency through templates, not complex tooling
- **Git-First**: All context and history captured in version control
- **AI-Optimized**: Designed for seamless Claude Code integration
- **Minimalist**: Lightweight orchestration, maximum flexibility

## Why DeepWorkspace?

Our thesis: By maintaining the most minimalist structure possible, we optimize for efficiency and elegance. This system captures endless complexity through modular nesting while remaining simple at its core.

### Key Benefits

1. **No Installation Required**: Just clone and follow the README
2. **Infinitely Scalable**: Projects within projects, any depth
3. **Self-Documenting**: The workspace follows its own rules
4. **Version Controlled**: Complete history of all changes
5. **AI-Friendly**: Optimized for Claude Code context

## External Repositories

No external repositories are currently integrated into the workspace system.
