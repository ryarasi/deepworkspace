  ## Rule Statement
  
  The workspace root MUST follow the exact same structure as any other project. There MUST be no special folders or exceptions. The workspace's content/ folder contains system files (templates, rules, scripts) instead of code or documents.
  
  ## Rationale
  
  This principle:
  - Eliminates special cases and exceptions
  - Makes the system self-demonstrating
  - Simplifies learning and maintenance
  - Proves the system works at any scale
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. Workspace structure:
     ```
     deepworkspace/
     ├── README.md      # Workspace documentation
     ├── CLAUDE.md      # Workspace AI context
     ├── content/       # System files (not .deepworkspace!)
     │   ├── templates/
     │   ├── rules/
     │   ├── scripts/
     │   ├── archive/
     │   └── temp/
     └── projects/      # All other projects
     ```
  
  2. Key insight:
     - No ".deepworkspace" or special system folder
     - System files go in content/ like any project
     - The only difference is what's IN content/
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Correct
  ```
  deepworkspace/
  ├── README.md          # Standard project file
  ├── CLAUDE.md          # Standard project file
  ├── content/           # Standard folder (contains system files)
  └── projects/          # Standard folder (contains projects)
  ```
  
  ### Incorrect
  ```
  deepworkspace/
  ├── README.md
  ├── CLAUDE.md
  ├── .deepworkspace/    # Wrong: special folder
  ├── system/            # Wrong: special folder
  └── projects/
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify this rule is being followed:
  - [ ] Workspace has README.md, CLAUDE.md
  - [ ] System files are in content/ folder
  - [ ] No special folders at root
  - [ ] Structure identical to any project
