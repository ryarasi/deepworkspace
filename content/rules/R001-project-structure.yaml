  ## Rule Statement
  
  Every project (including the workspace root) MUST have exactly these files and folders:
  - README.md - Human-readable documentation
  - CLAUDE.md - AI context and instructions
  - content/ - All actual project content
  - projects/ - Sub-projects (optional, can be empty)
  
  ## Rationale
  
  This creates a fractal, self-similar structure where:
  - Every project looks the same
  - Navigation is predictable
  - The workspace demonstrates its own rules
  - Complexity is managed through nesting
  
  ## Implementation
  
  1. When creating a new project:
     - Create the project directory
     - Add README.md using template T002
     - Add CLAUDE.md using template T003
     - Create content/ directory
     - Create projects/ directory (even if empty)
  
  2. The workspace root follows this same structure:
     - content/ contains system files (templates, rules, etc.)
     - projects/ contains all other projects
  
  ## Examples
  
  ### Correct
  ```
  my-project/
  ├── README.md
  ├── CLAUDE.md
  ├── content/
  │   └── [actual project files]
  └── projects/
      └── [sub-projects if any]
  ```
  
  ### Incorrect
  ```
  my-project/
  ├── README.md
  ├── src/           # Wrong: should be in content/
  ├── docs/          # Wrong: should be in content/
  └── .claude/       # Wrong: should be CLAUDE.md
  ```
  
  ## Verification
  
  To verify this rule is being followed:
  - [ ] Project has README.md at root
  - [ ] Project has CLAUDE.md at root
  - [ ] Project has content/ directory
  - [ ] Project has projects/ directory
  - [ ] No other files/folders at project root
  
references:
  - "T002"  # README template
  - "T003"  # CLAUDE.md template
  - "R004"  # Nesting rules
  
exceptions:
  - ".git/" directory for version control
  - ".gitignore" file at any level
  - ".pre-commit-config.yaml" at workspace root only
