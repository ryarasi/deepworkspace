# Workspace Context for Claude

<!-- This file follows template @content/templates/T003 -->

## ⚠️ CRITICAL BRANCH CHECK ⚠️
**BEFORE ANY EDITS**: Run `git branch` to verify you're NOT on main!
- If on main: Create feature branch with `git checkout -b feature/description`
- Use `./content/scripts/check-branch.sh` to verify compliance
- **R006 VIOLATION = BLOCKED EDITS** (hooks will prevent writes on main)

<!-- Dynamic branch context - generated by git hooks -->
<!-- @include .claude/branch-context.md (if exists) -->

You are in the DeepWorkspace root, which is itself a project following its own rules.

## Quick Orientation

1. **Start Here**: You're reading CLAUDE.md, the AI context entry point
2. **Read Next**: README.md for full workspace overview  
3. **Check Rules**: content/rules/ for all workspace rules
4. **Use Templates**: content/templates/ when creating files
5. **Follow Workflow**: Feature branches for all changes

## Critical Context

This workspace has a **fractal structure** - every project (including this workspace) follows the exact same pattern:
- README.md (human docs)
- CLAUDE.md (AI context) 
- content/ (actual content)
- projects/ (sub-projects, optional)

The workspace IS a project. No exceptions, no special folders.

## Navigation

```
Current Location: /deepworkspace/
├── You are here: CLAUDE.md
├── Human docs: README.md
├── System files: content/
│   ├── Templates: content/templates/T*.yaml
│   ├── Rules: content/rules/R*.yaml
│   ├── Scripts: content/scripts/*.sh
│   └── Temp: content/temp/
└── Projects: projects/*/CLAUDE.md
```

## Workflow Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All changes to files outside content/ MUST follow this workflow:

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. Make changes in feature branch
3. Commit with template T005 format
4. Create PR with template T006 format
5. Merge and cleanup

Use helper scripts:
- `./content/scripts/safe-edit.sh` - Start new feature
- `./content/scripts/create-pr.sh` - Create PR

## Key Rules to Remember

- **R001**: Every project has README.md, CLAUDE.md, content/
- **R002**: All work happens in content/ folders
- **R003**: Templates guide consistency
- **R004**: Projects can nest infinitely
- **R005**: Workspace follows its own rules
- **R006**: Feature branch workflow required
- **R007**: Commits follow template T005
- **R008**: PRs follow template T006

## DWS Script Validation

Always use DWS scripts to validate implementations:
- `dws validate` - Verify rule compliance before commits
- `dws fix` - Automatically resolve common issues
- `dws pr status` - Check PR workflow state
- Check `content/scripts/dws-lib/common.sh` for validation functions

Key validation patterns:
- Project structure compliance (R001)
- Template reference checking
- Rule numbering consistency
- Git workflow compliance

Note: Temp files belong in `.untracked/local/temp/`, not in `content/`

## Working with Projects

When entering any project:
1. Read its CLAUDE.md first
2. Check for sub-projects in projects/
3. Actual work is always in content/
4. Maintain the same structure

## Current Version
